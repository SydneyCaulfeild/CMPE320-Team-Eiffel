# CMPE320-Team-Eiffel
This repository contains Team Eiffel's course project for Fundamentals of Software Development at Queen's University. I worked on an agile team of 7 students, 
and together we developed a C++ program to help students find public study locations now that school buildings are closed due to 
COVID-19. Qt was used to develop the front end.
